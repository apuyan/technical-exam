# LWS Technical Exam

This document contains [LWS](https://github.com/lwshq)'s technical exam.  This is a standard 
application that provides a simple organizer for the user to store notes
and TODOs. You have 48 hours to send your PR and Answer the questions, complete or not.

## Instructions

  1. Fork this repository on your own personal GitHub account.
  2. Download your fork, build this app, and begin making changes.
  3. When finished, send an email containing your forked github repository to [@aindong](https://github.com/aindong) to let him know you're ready for
     review.
  4. We will close the fork after review.

  You may also submit your commits using =git format-patch=, should you
  prefer it over GitHub PRs.

## Specifications


`If you are applying for Backend, Disregard typescript and use pure Laravel.`

`If you are applying for a Frontend, Disregard the API Task and proceed with frontend only.`

`If you are applying for Full-Stack, You need to work on both API and Frontend in TypeScript.`


  1. The app consists of two major activities:
     - a note-taking activity that accepts a `title` and `text` for one
       or more notes
     - a TODO tracking activity that accepts an `entry`, with a
       `checkbox` to show whether this entry has been done or not done
  2. The app should have a user interface that allows for easy access
     between the note-taking and TODO tracking activities as well as to
     see their details at a glance.
  3. The note-taking activity should provide a view for its notes in a
     reverse-chronological order, with options for updating and deleting
     old notes.
  4. The TODO-tracking activity should provide a view for its entries
     with options for updating and deleting old TODOs.
  5. The app should make it easy to switch between the note-taking and
     TODO-tracking activities.
  6. The app should make it easy to switch a note to a TODO entry, and
     vice versa.
  7. The app should consists of both frontend and backend.
  8. Use `TypeScript` for the frontend and backend
  9. Include Unit/Functional Tests and make sure both has 70% and up test coverage
  10. Wrap everything and make sure we can run both frontend and backend easily.
